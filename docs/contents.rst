Welcome to depict's documentation!
==================================

Depict is built on the top of Bokeh. It aims at providing one-line access
to the most common types of graph by setting opinionated default and avoiding
boilerplate code. Graphs are aesthetic, efficiently rendered, interactive  and
sharable.

It is made for data-{scientist, analyst, engineer, lead, etc} seeking to
create beautiful plots while reducing the graph-tweaking time.
